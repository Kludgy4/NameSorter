# Name Sorter
[![Run Tests](https://github.com/Kludgy4/NameSorter/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kludgy4/NameSorter/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml)

The code in this repository is for the Dye and Durham Coding Assessment. It's written in C# with .NET (Assumedly Core?) compiling to run as a command line utility. The code tries to:
- Be empathetic to other team members
- Use SOLID principles
- Write quality tests

## Task
Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

## Criteria
- The solution should be available for review on github.
- The names should be sorted correctly.
- It should print the sorted list of names to screen.
- It should write/overwrite the sorted list of names to a file called sorted-names-list.txt.
- Unit tests should exist.
- Minimal, practical documentation should exist.
- Create a build pipeline that executes build and test steps
